# URIs
This is a place to align URIs among different projects for persons, places, works, manuscripts, and potentially other entities.

## How to use these URIs
Here you'll find TSV tables for each different entity. Each row is an entity; each column is domain with URIs for that type of entity. You can import this into the spreadsheet editor or data format of your choice and match against one URI in a row to get related URIs from other domains (projects).

This alignment assumes only that the URIs are related (formally, [dc:relation](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation) can be asserted) and are of the same entity type. It does *not* always mean that the URIs refer to exactly the same entity.
