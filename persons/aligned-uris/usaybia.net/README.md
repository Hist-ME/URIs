## Source Project
### [The Communities of Knowledge (Usaybia.net Project)](https://usaybia.net)

The person URIs here and their corresponding matches to URIs in other systems are based on those in the the usaybia.net dataset, which consists primarily of TEI-XML records and can be found in the [usaybia/usaybia-data](https://github.com/usaybia/usaybia-data/) repo. The dataset is also available as raw data from individual records at the [usaybia.net](https://usaybia.net) website or as an [archive package in Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3975506) ([DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3975505](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3975505)).

The initial identification of persons was based on the index of Emilie Savage-Smith, Simon Swain, and G. J. H. van Gelder, eds., _A Literary History of Medicine: The “Uyūn al-anbā” fī ṭabaqāt al-aṭibbā’ of Ibn Abī Uṣaybi’ah_, 5 vols. (Leiden: Brill, 2020), https://dh.brill.com/scholarlyeditions/library/urn:cts:arabicLit:0668IbnAbiUsaibia/.

The Usaybia.net team then aligned these persons with external resources. Other person records from or related to Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's text are added as relevant for the project's analysis.

## Version
### v0.4-beta
Records here are processed from [v0.4-beta](https://github.com/usaybia/usaybia-data/releases/tag/v0.4-beta) of the data available at the usaybia/usaybia-data repo.

However, while processing this data we may have deduplicated or disambiguated matches in ways not yet reflected in the source repo.

## External Authorities
We have attempted to match URIs to the following authorities:
| Authority | Entity Type | Typical Match Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Encyclopædia Iranica](https://iranicaonline.org) | reference articles for persons by URL | is the primary entity described by |
| [Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2) | reference articles for persons by DOI URL | is the primary entity described by |
| [Encyclopedia of Islam, THREE](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3) | reference articles for persons by DOI URL | is the primary entity described by |
| [Onomasticon Arabicum](onomasticon.irht.cnrs.fr) | person attestations with stable URLs | is the primary entity described by |
| [Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu) | reference articles for persons by URL | is the primary entity described by | 
| syriaca.org  | person URIs, usually for authors | is probably the same as |
| viaf.org  | person URIs, usually for authors | is probably the same as |
| wikipedia.org | reference articles for persons by URL | is the primary entity described by |

## Quirks
 - At this point, most of the persons we have aligned with external authorities are those who have biographical entries in Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa's _Uyūn al-anbāʾ_. 
 - Alignments are tentative and are still being reviewed. Feel free to create an issue here or in the source repo if you have corrections or suggestions.
