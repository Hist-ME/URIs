# Place URIs

This is a place to align place URIs among different projects. (More specific guidance regarding place URIs can be added here as needed.)

# documentation of datasets

Kima http://data.geo-kima.org/: the data set of all places with their (non Hebrew) variants more or less as uploaded to the WHG. The data is also available through an API here: http://data.geo-kima.org/swagger/index.html . The easiest way to reconcile with Kima entities is to clone the plugin https://github.com/embaral/KIMA-reconciliation for open refine.  Only half of the places are matched with Wikidata or geonames id and hence geocoded.
